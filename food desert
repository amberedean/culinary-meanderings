Have you noticed "desert" sounds a lot like "dessert," especially when you are talking about food?

They define a food desert as being more than 1 mile from a supermarket in a urban/suburban area and more than 10 miles in a rural area.
Their methodology uses tracts of land, I suspect it is a zip code.

I would define it as "if you live closer to a fast food restraunt than a place that sells produce." 
Basically, is it easier to get a BigMac than some broccoli? 

I think it would be interesting to also see if in urban areas, how long it would take to get to the nearest supermarket 
(time and distance to broccoli would be the velocity of broccoli, right?), especially considering public transportation routes.
