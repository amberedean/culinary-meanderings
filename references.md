Teng et al (2012) created a large dataset of recipes by crawling allrecipes.com: http://arxiv.org/pdf/1111.3919

IBM's recipe generation project is based in part on NLP analysis of food resources, but I'm not sure whether these resources are described in detail anywhere:

Malmaud et al's (2014) ACL paper "Cooking with Semantics"
http://www.cs.ubc.ca/~murphyk/Papers/acl2014.pdf is not a "resource" of the sort you're seeking but, similar to Teng et al it points to a corpus-driven approach to inducing some of the things you're looking forâ€”just the sort of thing we ought to recommend here on corpora-list. Even without the CURD database that Diarmuid links, a verb in the executable part of a recipe has a good chance of being a "process", and a noun phrase is likely to be an "ingredient".

I believe some work at U.Saarland covered food and recipes and generated resources in a variety of modalities; see e.g.
http://www.coli.uni-saarland.de/~regneri/docs/TACoS.pdf .
