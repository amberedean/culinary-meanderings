# Notes from The Language of Food

"Eatymology" - the language of food helps us to understand the interconnectedness of civilizations.

Computational linguistic tools given insight into covert clues that:
- Tells us about who we are from our perceptions and emotions to attitudes toward others.
- Predict the prices of dishes on a menu based on both absence and presence of words.
- Discover evidence from reviews that we tend toward the positive and optimistic. "Pollyanna affect"
- Learn more about health and choices

Descriptions on a menu leave latent linguistic clues about wealth and social class, views of food, and even things marketers don't intend us to see. [covert communication.]

Expensive restaurants:
- Attention to origins of food - 8 oz. blue start farms, grass fed & pasture raised... (15x more often)
- Fixed selection & price
- Fewer choices
- Fancier (longer) words - Zips suggested frequent words are shorter to make communication more efficient (ever letter increase is an 18c increase)
- Exotic or spices (framing)

Cheaper restaurants:
- More fillers such as colorful, flavorful. Also descriptive adjectives such as fresh, rich, flaky - Grice "maxim of relevance". Re-assurance.
- Real - which foods associated have to do with its value such that there is a fake substitute

**Structure of menu**

Entree as culinary status.

- Entree in 1555 meant "entering the table". Substantial hot meat dish with sauce - but evolved to become the third course after soup and fish.
- 19th century - Russian style dishes served in one course at a time. A list (menu) was provided.
- 1930s French - word meant a light course of eggs or seafood. 

Other clues from "language mavens" who complain about language uses.

Today, words such as entree are no longer a social marker of prestige. Authenticity is important.
